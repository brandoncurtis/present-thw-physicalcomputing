## Brought to you by...

This presentation is written in `reveal.js`

Assembled and tested in [Atom](https://atom.io/)

![atom text editor](img/atom.png)

------

## Challenge #1 - Get Code In

+ Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
+ OR... install a command-line compile-and-upload tool <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
+ Atom users: [arduino-upload package](https://atom.io/packages/arduino-upload) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

---

## What Code?

+ The Arduino IDE comes with lots of example code
+ I've provided two kinds of analog sensors
  + [LM35DZ temperature sensor](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm35.pdf)
  + [Photoresistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor)

------

## Challenge #2 - Get Data Out

+ Must print the data over the USB-serial connection to a computer
+ Arduino IDE has a built-in 'serial monitor'
+ Unix-y folks: `cat /dev/ttyACM0`
+ Can set [udev rules](https://www.brandoncurtis.com/files/arduino/50-arduino.rules) to e.g. always use /dev/arduino

------

## Challenge #3 - Plot The Data

+ Newest versions of the IDE include a basic plotter
+ Fire up Python with Numpy and Matplotlib?
+ Can you timestamp your data?
+ Can you plot the data in real-time?

------

## Homework - Libraries

+ [PID Library](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library/) implements a process controller
+ RTC library, digital sensor libraries, etc!
